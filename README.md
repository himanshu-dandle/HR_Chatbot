# HR Chatbot with Local AI Model

## Project Overview
This chatbot answers HR-related queries using both static data and a pre-trained AI model (DialoGPT). It remembers user inputs like their name and responds dynamically to other questions.

## Features
- Answers HR-related questions using a static dataset.
- Dynamically responds to open-ended questions using AI.
- Remembers user-specific details (e.g., name).
- Provides fallback responses for unsupported queries.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
 
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/HR_Chatbot.git
   

Usage
Run the chatbot:
	python local_chatbot.py

Start asking questions like:

What is the company's leave policy?
Tell me a joke.
What is my name?


Future Improvements
Integrate external APIs for real-time data (e.g., weather, news).
Improve response handling for fallback queries.
